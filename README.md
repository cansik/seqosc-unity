# seqosc Unity

The idea of this project was to create a very simple protocol that defines the format on how to store recordings of Open Sound Control (OSC) packets. A difference to other OSC sequencer is that this format allows a recorder or player to work with OSC packets without interpreting them. This leads to a huge performance boost.
